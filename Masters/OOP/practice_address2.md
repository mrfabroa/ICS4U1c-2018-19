# practice_address2.py

1. Refer to your Address class from previous practice.  Redefine it in a file practice_address2.py such that the 
print_address() method is defined *inside* the class and uses the class' attributes to print out the address in the form

```text
street address line 1
street address line 2 (if it has a value)
city, province, postalcode
Country
```

2. Write a program that creates an instance of an Address, sets its attributes, and calls on the instances print_address() method.
