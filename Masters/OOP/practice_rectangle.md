# practice_rectangle.py

In your Working directory, create a python file called practice_rectangle.py.

1. Define a class Rectangle that has attributes `width` and `height` defaulted to 0.

2. Write a `main()` function that gets a `width` and `height` value from user input  Create an instance of a Rectangle called `rect1` and assign values to its `width` and `height` attributes the values collected from user input.  Print out the area of `rect1`
based on itâ€™s `width` and `height` attributes.  Don't forget to call your `main()` function to run your code 

3. Write a function `get_area(rec)` such that given a Rectangle object `rec` that returns the area of `rec`.  Edit your `main()` to use the `get_area(rec)` function.
