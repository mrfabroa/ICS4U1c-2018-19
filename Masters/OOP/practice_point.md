# practice_point.py

1. Define a class Point that has attributes `x` and `y` that are set at the time of creation via the constructor parameters.
2. Within the Point class, define a method `get_distance(other_point)` that returns the distance between the the current object and another Point object `other_point`
3. Write a program that creates two Point instances `p1`  and `p2` and outputs the distance between them.
